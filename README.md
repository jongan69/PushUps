# PushUps: a pushup workout app for Apple Watch

with HealthKit and SwiftUI.

## Overview

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode:

1. Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.
2. Select the top-level project.
3. For the three targets, select the correct team in the Signing & Capabilities pane (next to Team) to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.
4. Make a note of the Bundle Identifier of the WatchKit App target.
5. Open the `Info.plist` file of the WatchKit Extension target, and change the value of the `NSExtension` > `NSExtensionAttributes` > `WKAppBundleIdentifier` key to the bundle ID you noted in the previous step.
6. Make a clean build and run the sample app on your device.
